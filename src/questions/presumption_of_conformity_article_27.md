## Questions - Presumption of conformity - Article 27
-  **Use of Harmonised Standards**:  Are you aware that your product and processes that comply with the relevant harmonised standards (or parts of them) published in the Official Journal of the EU, are presumed conform with Annex I requirements?
-  **Awareness of Commission Requests for Standards**: Are you aware that the Commission may request European standardisation organisations to develop harmonised standards for Annex I requirements, and that these standards may later affect how you demonstrate conformity?
-  **Use of Common Specifications (If No Harmonised Standard Exists)**: If harmonised standards are unavailable, have you checked whether the Commission has issued implementing acts that establish common specifications that you must follow to obtain presumption of conformity?
-  **Compliance With Common Specifications**: If common specifications have been issued under Article 27(2) (these bullets mentioned above), are your products and processes compliant with them so you can be presumed conformant with Annex I?
-  **Use of EU Cybersecurity Certification Schemes**: If your product has obtained an EU cybersecurity certificate or EU statement of conformity under Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (todo might need to search what this is) , have you confirmed which Annex I requirements are covered so that you can rely on presumption of conformity for those parts?
-  **Reduced Assessment Burden Through Certification**: If you hold a cybersecurity certificate at assurance level ‘substantial’ or higher, have you ensured that you are not redundantly performing third-party conformity assessments for requirements already covered by the certificate? (check Article 32(2) point a,b Article 32(3) points a b questions)
-  **Updates Due to Delegated Acts**: Are you monitoring whether the Commission specifies additional cybersecurity certification schemes (via delegated acts under Article 61) that you may use to demonstrate conformity?
