# Other provisions related to reporting  - Article 17

## Public awareness  
-  **Cooperation When Public Awareness Is Needed**: If the CSIRT determines that public awareness is necessary to prevent or mitigate a severe incident affecting your product, are you prepared to cooperate with the CSIRT and ENISA, and provide any information required for them to inform the public or issue warnings?
## Legal Liabilities regarding reporting 
-  **Impact of Notifications on Legal Liability**: Do you understand that submitting notifications under Articles 14 and 15 does _not_ increase your legal liability or subject you to additional penalties beyond what already applies?
## CSIRT helpdesk 
 **Awareness of CSIRT Support for Reporting Obligations**: Are you aware that CSIRTs designated as coordinators may provide helpdesk support to assist manufacturers—especially SMEs and microenterprises—with their reporting obligations under Articles 14 and 15?
