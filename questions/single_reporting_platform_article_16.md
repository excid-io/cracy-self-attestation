# Single Reporting Platform - Article 16
## Establishment and Operation of the Platform 
- **Awareness of Single Reporting Platform**: Are you aware that all notifications under Articles 14 and 15  (point to the corresponding question section here) must be submitted via the single reporting platform established and operated by ENISA?
-  **Electronic Notification Endpoints**: Do you understand that Member States and ENISA may set up their own electronic notification endpoints that connect to the single reporting platform?
## CSIRT Dissemination of Notifications 

 - **Immediate Dissemination**: Are you aware that the CSIRT receiving your notification must immediately disseminate it through the platform to the CSIRTs in all relevant Member States?
 -  **Conditions for Delayed Dissemination**: Do you understand that dissemination may be delayed upon your request, under notification Article 14(2)(a), if you indicate that the information is sensitive under Article 12(1) of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (check below) ?
	 - The tasks of the CSIRT designated as coordinator shall include:
		1. identifying and contacting the entities concerned;
		2. assisting the natural or legal persons reporting a vulnerability; and
		3. **negotiating disclosure timelines and managing vulnerabilities that affect multiple entities**.
-  **Justification for Delay**: If dissemination is delayed, can you provide:
	- a justification for withholding the information, and
	- an indication of when dissemination should occur?

## **Exceptional Circumstances (points a–c)**
- **Exceptional Case: Single-State Exploitation**: Can you demonstrate when needed that a vulnerability is exploited only in one Member State and therefore dissemination to others could be delayed?
-  **Exceptional Case: Member State Interest Risk**: Are you able to justify delays when disclosure may supply sensitive information that contradicts the essential security interests of a Member State?
-  **Exceptional Case: Imminent Cybersecurity Risk**: Do you understand that dissemination can be delayed if immediate sharing poses a high cybersecurity risk?
## **Minimal Information Requirement**
- **Minimal Information Sharing**: Are you aware that even in exceptional delays, certain minimal information (such as notification acknowledgement and general exploit information) may still be shared?
## **ENISA’s Role**
-  **ENISA Risk Assessment**: Do you understand that ENISA may recommend full dissemination to the CSIRT if it considers the vulnerability a **systemic risk to the internal market**, despite the exceptional case? 

##  **Notification to Market Surveillance Authorities**
- **Market Surveillance Notifications**: Do you understand that CSIRTs must provide market surveillance authorities with the information they need to perform oversight in response to your notification?

## Enisa Responsibilities
- **Secure Handling & Protection of Submitted Vulnerability Information**:  Do you understand that any vulnerability information you submit through the single reporting platform will be handled under strict security protocols, shared only on a need-to-know basis, and protected even when no corrective or mitigating measures are available—ensuring your sensitive disclosures are not improperly disseminated?

## CVD weird case 
-  **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) & Delayed Dissemination**: Do you understand that if a vulnerability is part of a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process, do you have procedures to request delayed dissemination of the notification—limited to what is strictly necessary—until CVD partners consent, while still maintaining the ability to voluntarily report the vulnerability through the single reporting platform?
