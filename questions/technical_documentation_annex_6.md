# Questions - Technical Documentation - Annex VII
- **Software version compliance and updates**: Have you assessed whether the current software version — and any subsequent updates — continue to comply with the essential cybersecurity requirements under the Cyber Resilience Act, and documented how changes in software versions may affect that compliance?
- **User instructions (Annex II)**: Have you created adequate and correct user instructions? (see more in Annex II **Information and Instructions to the User**)

	- **Integrity of data and software**: Are there mechanisms to protect data, programs, and configurations from unauthorized modification, and to detect and report any corruption?
	- **Data minimization**: Does the product collect and process only the data necessary for its intended purpose, avoiding unnecessary personal or other data?
	- **Availability and resilience**: Have you implemented measures to ensure essential functions remain available even after incidents, including mitigation against denial-of-service attacks?
	- **Minimizing negative impact on other systems**: Have you implemented measures to ensure essential functions remain available even after incidents, including mitigation against denial-of-service attacks?
	- **Limiting attack surfaces**: Have you designed and produced the product to minimize attack surfaces, especially through secure management of external interfaces?
	- **Reducing impact of incidents**: Are appropriate mechanisms and techniques in place to reduce the impact of cybersecurity incidents?
	- **Monitoring and logging**: Does the product record and monitor internal activity relevant to security, including access to or modification of data, and allow users to opt out where required?
	- **Secure data deletion and transfer**: Can users securely erase or transfer personal data and settings, ensuring that this process is done safely and cannot compromise security?
- **Support period definition for the PDE**: Have you determined and documented the support period for the product with digital elements (PDE) so that it reflects the expected lifetime of the product, taking into account reasonable user expectations, the product’s intended purpose, relevant Union law on product lifetimes, and comparable support periods for similar products on the market? 
- **Support period justification and external factors**: Have you also considered factors such as the availability of the operating environment, support periods of integrated third-party components providing core functions, and guidance from the Administrative Cooperation Group (ADCO) or the European Commission, ensuring the support period is proportionate and not less than five years unless the expected use period is shorter?
	- Note that the ADCO might later specify other support periods for specific product categories where market surveillance indicates inadequate support periods 

- **Obligations during support period (Annex I Part II)**: During the support period have you made sure that ( Annex I Part II ):
