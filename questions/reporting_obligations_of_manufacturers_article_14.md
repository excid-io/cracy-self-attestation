# Questions - Reporting Obligations of Manufacturers - Article 14
## Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities - General Obligation 
 - **Awareness & Reporting Process**: Do you have a defined process to detect and identify actively exploited vulnerabilities in your product with digital elements?
 - **Mandatory Reporting**: When you become aware of an actively exploited vulnerability, do you notify the CSIRT coordinator and ENISA without undue delay via the single reporting platform?
## Early Warning Reporting 
- **Early Warning Reporting**: Can you provide an early warning notification within 24 hours of becoming aware of an actively exploited vulnerability?
-  **Early Warning Content**: Does your early warning notification include the Member States where the affected product has been made available (when applicable)?
## Vulnerability Notification - General Information 
- **72-Hour Vulnerability Notification**: Can you submit a vulnerability notification within 72 hours of discovering an actively exploited vulnerability?
-  **Required Content Check**: Does your 72-hour report include:
    - General information about the affected product?
    - The nature of the exploit and the vulnerability?
    - Corrective or mitigating measures taken?
    - Recommended actions for users?
    - A sensitivity rating (if applicable)?
## Final Report 
-  **Final Report Timing**: Can you provide a final report within 14 days after a corrective or mitigating measure is available?
-  **Final Report Content** :Does your final report include:
    - A description of the vulnerability, severity, and impact?
    - Information about malicious actors exploiting it (if available)?
    - Details of applied updates or mitigation measures?
## Criteria for Classifying a Severe Incident 
-  **Severe Incident Assessment**: Do you classify an incident as severe if it impacts availability, authenticity, integrity, or confidentiality of sensitive or important data?
-  **Malicious Code Criterion**: Do you classify an incident as severe if it leads to the introduction/execution of malicious code in your product or users’ systems?
## Reporting Severe Incidents 
- **Severe Incident Awareness**: Do you have a process to detect severe incidents affecting the security of your product?
### (a) Early Warning Notification – Severe Incident (within 24 hours)
- **24-Hour Severe Incident Notification**: Can you submit an early warning notification of a severe incident within 24 hours of becoming aware of it?
- **Early Warning Content – Severe Incident**: Does the early warning for severe incidents include:
	- Whether the incident is malicious/unlawful?
	- The Member States where affected products were made available?
### **(b) Incident Notification – General Information (within 72 hours)**
-  **72-Hour Severe Incident Notification**:  Do you submit an incident notification within 72 hours of discovering a severe incident?
-  **Required Content for Severe Incident Report**: Does the 72-hour incident notification include:
    - General information about the incident?
    - Initial assessment of severity?
    - Corrective or mitigating actions already taken?
    - Mitigation actions users can take?
    - A sensitivity rating?
### (c) Final Report – Severe Incident (within one month)
-  **Final Report Timeline**: Can you provide a final severe incident report within one month following your 72-hour notification?
-  **Final Report Content – Severe Incident**: Does your final report include:
    - Detailed description, severity, and impact?
    - The likely root cause or threat type?
    - Applied and ongoing mitigation measures?
### Notification Submission Method (CSIRT Coordinator)
- **Main Establishment in the EU**: Have you identified the Member State of your main establishment for submitting notifications via the CSIRT coordinator?
- **No EU Establishment**: If you have no main establishment in the EU, can you determine the correct CSIRT based on **in order**:
	- Have you identified **the EU Member State where your authorised representative is established**, _specifically the representative that acts on your behalf for the highest number of products with digital elements (PDEs)_?
	- Have you determined **which importer places the highest number of your PDEs on the EU market**, and **in which Member State that importer is established**?  If no authorised representative exists, this becomes the **next criterion**.	
	- Have you identified **the distributor who makes available the highest number of your PDEs**, and **the EU Member State where that distributor is established**?  This is the **third fallback criterion**.
	- Have you assessed **which Member State has the highest number of users** of your PDEs?

### **Consistent CSIRT Reporting** ( Depending on the Submission Method )
- Once a CSIRT has been designated as the coordinator for your product (after selecting it according to the rules in points (a)–(d)), do you ensure that **all subsequent notifications** of actively exploited vulnerabilities or severe incidents for that product are **submitted to the same CSIRT**, even if future incidents occur in different Member States?
### User Notification Obligations 
-  **User Notifications**: Do you inform users, without undue delay, about vulnerabilities or severe incidents and provide them with actionable mitigation instructions?
-  **Automatic Format**: Can you provide user notifications in a structured, machine-readable format when required?
## Responsibilities When the Manufacturer Fails to Inform Users
-  **CSIRT Fallback**: Are you aware that if you fail to inform users promptly, the CSIRT coordinator may notify users on your behalf?
## Upcoming EU Rules 
- **Delegated Acts Awareness**: Are you prepared to comply with future delegated acts defining rules for delayed dissemination of notifications?
- **Implementing Acts Awareness**: Do you have internal processes ready to adopt new reporting formats or procedures defined by future implementing acts?
